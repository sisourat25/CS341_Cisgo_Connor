IP 10.12.116.141
Port 3000
The project is deployed on the virtual machine (VM) with the IP 10.12.116.141 on port 3000. 
To access the VM, you will need to contact the IS department and/or a professor to get 
admin access through sudo. Once they add you as a user, you can ssh into the VM through your
terminal when on campus wifi. Use the command...

    ssh <UP USER ID>@campus.up.edu@10.12.116.141

TO STOP THE PROJECT:
    - find the PID of the node project listening on port 3000 using the command 
        sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
    - kill the process using the command 
        kill -9 <PID>

TO START THE PROJECT:
    - once logged into the VM, exit out of your user directory
    - go to sisourat25 directory
    - go to deployed directory
    - continue cd * until the project files are reached
    - run the command
        sudo npm start

TO ACCESS THE DEPLOYED PROJECT:
    - go to a web browser and enter 10.12.116.141:3000
    - ONLY ACCESSIBLE WHEN USING CAMPUS wifi

Users can only access the project when on campus wifi. The IS/IT department is still trying to make the
port and VM public facing so anyone can access it on other networks.
