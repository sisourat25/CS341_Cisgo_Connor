            This mapping project was conceived as a way to share the good work that UP faculty, 
            staff, and alumni have engaged in around the world. The map stores information about 
            different projects, research, work and other activities that our community has 
            completed or is currently engaged in. <br> <br>We hope that this map serves as a resource 
            for our UP community to connect with one another, share expertise, and brainstorm 
            future projects. See the CISGO website for information on all the activities of the 
            Collaborative on International Studies and Global Outreach. <br><br> For more information, 
            contact the site administrator at cisgomap@up.edu.
