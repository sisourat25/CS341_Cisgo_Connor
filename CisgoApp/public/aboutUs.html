        The University of Portland has been brainstorming ways to show students 
        the many opportunuties abroad. This website was created to help with that. 
        Aiming to connect people who are interested in making an impact, and offering 
        a place to ask questions and learn more. It provides students with information 
        and contact information so that they can reach out to learn more or get involved.
        Acting as a simple way to view all abroad opportunuties and connections UP offers.
