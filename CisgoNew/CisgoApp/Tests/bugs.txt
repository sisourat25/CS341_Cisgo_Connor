Performance testing bugs:

1.) Changing the status of many points that are selected at once

Problem: When the admin is attempting to change the status from pending to approved or vice versa, 
of many points (more than 5) at a single time, the admin page becomes frozen and the user must refresh.

Perceived Source of Problem: In the js to change the status, it loops through each point with the specified numid
and sends that to the route to change it. The loop time that it is in the loop is too short compared to what the
route is actually doing. This results in inconsistencies.

Intended fix: Instead of looping through each point and changing the status iteratively, we can send a list of the ones
that must be directly to the route. This way, the route can change the status of the points all at once.
